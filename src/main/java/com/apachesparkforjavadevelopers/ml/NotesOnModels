Machine Learning models are split into the two categories (1) supervised learning and (2) unsupervised learning.

1 Supervised Learning
Models that predict an outcome.
1.1 Linear Regression
Used when looking for an answer in a continuous range.

1.2 Logistic Regression
Used when the answer is binary.

1.3 Decision Tress
Used when the answer is in a discrete set.

2 Unsupervised Learning
Models that find relationships based on labels.
2.1 K Means Clustering
E.g. relationships between bought products are used to recommend another product.

2.2 Matrix Factorisation
E.g. relationships between people (i.e. similarities in their labels) who buy certain products are used to recommend
another product.
